== Background

Doing a *bit* for Halloween and handing out hot dogs. This is a one day coding challange to make a 7-eleven inspired Halloween reciept to give when handing out Hot Dogs. The intention is to be as confusing, hence in the spirit of Halloween both tricking and treating. 

The code is not AI generated and 100% user made garbage. Given more time I am sure I can clean up code and optimize but this is just a Halloween thing.

== Quick Start
* Copy code to a raspberry Pi (no gui).
* Creat a python venv and load requiremnts.txt.
* move 99-escpos.rules into etc/udev/rules.d/
* call the python script from the end of the bash.rc script
* Attach https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V4H7T47?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title[this] thermal printer.
* Attach Just a number pad
* Attach https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC9Y3HY6[this] cash register to thermal printer.
* restart the system.
* All done!
